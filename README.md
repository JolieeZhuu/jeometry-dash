## What is the purpose of the program “Jeometry Dash”?
The purpose of Jeometry Dash is to create a fun and interesting program for students to play and use for education purposes. Our game allows students to learn about Object Oriented Programming, Java Swing/AWT, arrays, and much more. This way, our interactive game combines education and fun.

## How do you use “Jeometry Dash”?
To run Jeometry Dash, you must have java installed into your computer. All you need to do is run the "JeometryDash.bat" file on your computer. Any Java interpreter will work with our program, however, we recommend Java 8 for the game to run smoothest.         

## Troubleshooting Tips        
If you have tried to run our program, and it will not open a window, you have probably run into a syntax error. This is because you have accidentally indented or removed part of the program (a word, colon, or quotation). To fix this problem, delete the JeometryDash.zip file and download a new zip file.

## Tip to play the game
Press spacebar to jump. If you are finding it difficult to complete the game, you may hold the spacebar to jump over obstacles.
